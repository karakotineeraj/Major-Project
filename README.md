# AUTOMATED PARKING SYSTEM
* Automating Parking System is a web project. In this project, we have tried to solve the “Major problem is the security of community(society) and budget on the security.”
* When a vehicle enters the society gate, the record will be kept and the same will be done at the time exit. Even for the non-residents / outsiders / visitors the data will be entered for security purpose along with the flat no. and purpose of visiting. The same will be checked at the time of exit and record will be kept in database.
* We automated the storing and managing problem of the old manual record keeping of visitors.
* We provided the services among members and the working staff of society.
* We installed a safety alarm/hooter that will detect any suspicious activity happening at the gates, i.e., if a non-member is trying to enter the society, someone trying to take the car out of society without the owner’s permission, someone trying to access the security premises without the guard’s knowledge, etc.
* This system is going to benefit the users in various ways starting from a limited budget to a safe and secure environment. This is going to help the admin of society in developing faith and relying on the safety measurements of their society because of highly secure entry system. Also, members will feel free towards the safety of their vehicles and can live a stress-free life.
